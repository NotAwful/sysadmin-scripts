# sysadmin-scripts
A collection of scripts I use to automate tasks.

## ghostmv.sh
Purpose: A short script that moves files on a linux ghost installation to a public-facing folder, and edits permissions to allow access. Additionally creates that location if it does not already exist.
Note: I use this to quickly update my resume on my website.
Usage: ghostmv.sh /file/to/be/moved
